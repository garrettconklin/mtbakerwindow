# Holiday Light Mockup Tool V.2 - Corrected Integration Guide

## Problem Solved âœ…
The tool was accidentally deployed to replace your homepage at mtbakerwindows.com. I've now created a proper integration where the tool will be hosted as a separate page on your domain.

## Solution: Proper Integration Setup

### Step 1: Upload the Tool File
Your web developer should:
1. Save the code as `holiday-light-mockup.html`
2. Upload it to a `/tools/` directory on your server
3. The tool will be accessible at: `https://mtbakerwindows.com/tools/holiday-light-mockup.html`

### Step 2: Add Your "Customize Your Home" Button
On your Holiday Light service page, add this button:

```html
<a href="/tools/holiday-light-mockup.html" target="_blank" class="your-button-class">
    Customize Your Home
</a>
```

**Or as a button element:**
```html
<button onclick="window.open('/tools/holiday-light-mockup.html', '_blank')" class="your-button-class">
    Customize Your Home
</button>
```

## Perfect User Experience ðŸŽ¯

### What Happens:
1. **User visits your Holiday Light page** (your normal website)
2. **User clicks "Customize Your Home"** 
3. **New tab opens** with the mockup tool at `/tools/holiday-light-mockup.html`
4. **Your homepage stays intact** - no interference with your main website
5. **User designs their lights** in the tool
6. **User can easily return** to your main website to request a quote

## Features Included âœ¨
- **8 Light Patterns** with realistic rendering
- **String Light Drawing** with professional bulb placement  
- **Mini Light Areas** with density controls
- **Professional Dusk Filter** converts day photos to evening
- **Before/After Toggle** for comparison
- **Export Functionality** to download mockups
- **Responsive Design** works on all devices
- **Mt Baker Windows Branding** in the header

## File Structure
```
your-website/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html (your homepage - unchanged)
â”œâ”€â”€ holiday-lights.html (your service page)
â”œâ”€â”€ tools/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ holiday-light-mockup.html (the new tool)
â””â”€â”€ other-pages...
```

## Customization Options
Your web developer can easily customize:
- **Company branding** in the tool header
- **Button styling** to match your website design
- **Colors** to match your brand palette

This setup keeps your homepage completely separate while giving customers access to the professional mockup tool through a clean, branded experience!
