# Holiday Light Mockup Tool - Deployment Instructions

## ðŸŽ¯ **Problem Solved**
The tool was redirecting to your homepage instead of showing as its own page. This creates a standalone version that your employees can access directly.

## ðŸ“§ **Send This to Your Web Manager**

**Subject:** Holiday Light Tool - Create Direct Access URL

**Message:**
"Hi [Web Manager Name],

Please create a direct URL for our Holiday Light Mockup Tool so employees can access it directly and share it with customers.

**What to do:**
1. Upload the attached `holiday-light-tool.html` file to our server
2. Make it accessible at: `mtbakerwindows.com/holiday-light-tool`
3. Test that it loads the tool (not the homepage)

**Files attached:**
- `holiday-light-tool.html` (complete standalone tool)
- `DEPLOYMENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md` (this file)

**Result:** 
- Direct URL: `mtbakerwindows.com/holiday-light-tool`
- Employees can bookmark and share this link
- Tool works independently from homepage

Let me know when it's live!

Thanks,
